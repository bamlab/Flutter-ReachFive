# Flutter-ReachFive-Platform-Interface

---

A common platform interface for the `flutter_reach_five` plugin.

This interface allows platform-specific implementations of the `flutter_reach_five` plugin, as well as the plugin itself, to ensure they are supporting the same interface.

---

# Usage

To implement a new platform-specific implementation of `flutter_reach_five`, extend `FlutterReachFivePlatform` with an implementation that performs the platform-specific behavior.
